## MPH (MINQUE for Partitioning Heritability)
MPH is a C++ program for fast REML estimation of genetic variance and covariance components.

The method has the following properties:

- It is fast and memory-efficient.
- It has robust convergence.
- It supports the analyses of dominance, epistasis, and genetic correlation.
- It can perform complex genome-partitioning of quantitative genetic variation and covariation.
