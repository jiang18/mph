## Examples

### Datasets

#### QTL-MAS 2012
- The data set is available for download [here](https://github.com/jiang18/mph/raw/main/examples/QTL-MAS-2012.zip).
- [This article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25519515/) describes how the data set was simulated.
- 3k related animals, 10k SNPs, 5 chromosomes, and 3 traits

#### Simulated sequence genotypes
- The data set is available for download [here]().
- Simulated by [genosim](https://aipl.arsusda.gov/software/genosim/)
- 10k unrelated individuals, 5M sequence variants, and 30 chromosomes
- Functional annotations are quickly simulated by assigning [LDSC baseline annotations](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/broad-alkesgroup-public-requester-pays/LDSCORE/1000G_Phase3_baseline_ldscores.tgz) to the sequence variants in order.
- Phenotypes are simulated using the S-LDSC baseline result for human traits.
