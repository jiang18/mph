## MPH
**MPH** (**M**INQUE for **P**artitioning **H**eritability) is a C++ program for fast REML estimation of genetic (co)variance components.

The method has the following properties:

- It implements Fisher-scoring REML (equivalent to iterative MINQUE) alongside a trust-region dogleg algorithm.
- It is fast and memory-efficient.
- It has robust convergence.
- It supports the analyses of dominance, epistasis, and genetic correlation.
- It can perform complex genome-partitioning of quantitative genetic variation and covariation.
