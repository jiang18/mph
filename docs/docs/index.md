**MPH** (**M**INQUE for **P**artitioning **H**eritability) is a C++ program for fast REML estimation of genetic variance components.

The method has the following properties:

- It is fast and memory-efficient.
- It has robust convergence.
- It supports the analyses of dominance, epistasis, and genetic correlation.
- It can perform complex genome-partitioning of quantitative genetic variation.
