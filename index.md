# MINQUE for Partitioning Heritability
MPH is designed to partition SNP heritability with genotypes of related samples or with long-span LDs. For such data, [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc), [Haseman-Elston (HE) regression](https://github.com/sriramlab/RHE-mc), or [MQS](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA) does not work well.
1. MPH is comparable to GREML in terms of accuracy, while being much faster and more memory-efficient.
2. It can do weighted analyses if residual variances are unequal (such as daughter yield deviations [DYDs] of bulls).
3. It works for many overlapping functional annotations.
