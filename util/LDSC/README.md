# Simple R scripts for LD score regression (LDSC)
1. cal_scores.R calculates LD scores using a square LD r2 matrix generated by Plink. Only good for a small number of SNPs (such as 50k).
2. ldsc_irls.R is an R implementation of LDSC using the scores from cal_scores.R. No jackknife estimation of SE. 

# Differences from the original LDSC
1. All genome-wide SNPs are used for LD scores. 
2. The IRLS is exactly the Newtonâ€“Raphson method. (The original LDSC simplifies the weights in IRLS.)


The intercept is constrained to 1 in the function ***irls_unit***.
